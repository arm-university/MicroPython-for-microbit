# Programming with MicroPython
Learn about all the programming techniques in the GCSE Computer Science curriculum using micro:python to program a micro:bit. Learners apply these techniques across several projects, mirroring real-world product development.

## Resource Aim
This programming course covers the foundational computational techniques required for 14-16 Computer Science in the UK. It also introduces learners to the key STEM topics of iterative development, abstraction, decomposition and creative problem solving through project-based learning. Learners will be immersed in a series of projects which involve rapid team-based development of a solution to meet specified criteria.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
